# Overview of Challenge 
The purpose of the Python script is to analyze the financial records of a company using a dataset (`budget_data.csv`). The dataset contains the following information:
- Date(month and year).
- Profit/Losses

# Python was used to perform the following analysis:
1. Total number of months included in the dataset.
2. Net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period.
3. Average change in "Profit/Losses" between months.
4. Greatest increase in profits (date and amount).
5. Greatest decrease in profits (date and amount).

### These are the external sources used to analyze the data 
- I referred to the Python documentation on [reading and writing CSV files](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) to handle the CSV file in the challenge.
- Several portions of the script were influenced by discussions and solutions found on Stack Overflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7165749/open-file-in-a-relative-location-in-python)
- I also used information from [Real Python's article on reading and writing files](https://realpython.com/read-write-files-python/) to understand how to output the results to a text file.
  
### Acknowledgements:
- No collaboration with peers was involved in this project.
- All referenced external code was appropriately adapted and cited.
